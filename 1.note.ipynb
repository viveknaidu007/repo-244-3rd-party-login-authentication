    " how user authentication works when integrating third-party login methods (Google, Facebook, GitHub, etc.) while your backend requires a `username`, `email`, and `password` for each user.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Third-Party Authentication Works:\n",
    "When a user signs in via Google, Facebook, or GitHub, they don’t manually provide an email, username, or password. Instead, your application receives authentication data from these platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Steps for Google/Facebook/GitHub Login:\n",
    "1. **User Clicks \"Sign in with Google\" (or other provider)**  \n",
    "   - This redirects them to the provider's login page.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **User Grants Permission**  \n",
    "   - The provider (Google, Facebook, etc.) asks for permission to share basic profile details (like email, name, profile picture, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Provider Sends an Authentication Token**  \n",
    "   - After successful authentication, the provider sends your backend an **OAuth token** (JWT or access token).\n",
    "   - You can use this token to get the user’s **email, name, and profile picture**.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Backend Checks the User in the Database**  \n",
    "   - If the email exists:\n",
    "     - Log them in.\n",
    "   - If the email does **not** exist:\n",
    "     - Create a new account with the provided email.\n",
    "     - Generate a unique `username` (e.g., based on email or auto-generated).\n",
    "     - **No need to store a password** because authentication happens via Google/Facebook/GitHub.\n",
    "\n",

    "#### **Manual Signup:**\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"_id\": \"67a482864f5d3098febec41f\",\n",
    "  \"username\": \"vivek\",\n",
    "  \"email\": \"vivek@gmail.com\",\n",
    "  \"password\": \"hashed_password\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Google Signup (No Password):**\n",
    "```json\n",
    "{\n",
    "  \"_id\": \"67a482864f5d3098febec41f\",\n",
    "  \"username\": \"vivek32\",  \n",
    "  \"email\": \"vivek32@gmail.com\",\n",
    "  \"auth_provider\": \"google\", \n",
    "  \"google_id\": \"1039281293821\",\n",
    "  \"profile_picture\": \"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/photo.jpg\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- **No password is stored** for Google/Facebook login.\n",
    "- **Usernames must be handled differently** (since Google doesn’t provide one).\n",
    "  - You can auto-generate one (`vivek32` from `vivek@gmail.com`).\n",
    "  - You can ask the user to set a username **after** signing in.\n",
    "- **OAuth tokens are used instead of passwords** for authentication.\n"
